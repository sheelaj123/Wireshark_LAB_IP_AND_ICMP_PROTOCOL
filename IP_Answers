Q.1 Select the first ICMP Echo Request message sent by your computer, and expand
the Internet Protocol part of the packet in the packet details window.
What is the IP address of your computer..?
ANS:---> The IP address of my computer is 192.168.43.191


Q.2 Within the IP packet header, what is the value in the upper layer protocol field?
ANS:---> The value in the upper layer protocol field is ICMP 1 or (0x01)


Q.3 How many bytes are in the IP header? How many bytes are in the payload of the
IP datagram? Explain how you determined the number of payload bytes.
ANS:--- Here as shown in figure , 20 bytes in the IP header, and 96 bytes total length, this
gives 76 bytes in the payload of the IP datagram.


Q.4 Has this IP datagram been fragmented? Explain how you determined whether
or not the datagram has been fragmented.
ANS:--- The more fragments bit = 0, so the data is not fragmented.


Q.5 Which fields in the IP datagram always change from one datagram to the next
within this series of ICMP messages sent by your computer?
ANS:--- In the Identification, Time to live and Header checksum always change.


Q.6 Which fields stay constant? Which of the fields must stay constant? Which fields
must change? Why?
ANS:--- The fields that stay constant across the IP datagrams are:
• Version (since we are using IPv4 for all packets)
• header length (since these are ICMP packets)
• source IP (since we are sending from the same source)
• destination IP (since we are sending to the same dest)
• Upper Layer Protocol (since these are ICMP packets)
The fields that must stay constant are:
• Version (since we are using IPv4 for all packets)
• header length (since these are ICMP packets)
• source IP (since we are sending from the same source)
• destination IP (since we are sending to the same dest)
• Upper Layer Protocol (since these are ICMP packets)
The fields that must change are:
• Identification(IP packets must have different ids)
• Time to live (traceroute increments each subsequent packet)
• Header checksum (since header changes, so must checksum)

Q.7 Describe the pattern you see in the values in the Identification field of the IP
datagram..?
ANS:--- The pattern is that the IP header Identification fields increment with each ICMP
Echo (ping) request.
